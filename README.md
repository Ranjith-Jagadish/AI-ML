# üéâ Object Detection with YOLOv8  

Welcome to the **Object Detection** project! This repository contains code and resources for detecting objects in images using the YOLOv8 algorithm.

## üì∏ Dataset Overview  

The dataset consists of:  
- **79 annotated images**  
- Annotations are in the **YOLOv8** format.  

### Pre-Processing Steps  
- Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)  
- Resize to **640x640** (Stretch)  

### Data Augmentation  
We applied the following augmentations to increase the dataset's robustness:  
- **50% probability** of horizontal flip.  
- Random Gaussian blur between **0 and 2 pixels**.
